# SLM-P3HM
Code for P3HM Holography SLM lab


GS.py contains my implementation of the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm.
It's all split up into separate functions e.g. a function for making the grid and a function to add a trap.
All functions are run below their definition to show proper usage.


GUI.py contains the classes for the GUI 
Manipulation class is the main screen containing the buttons to change the location of the trap and recalculate the pattern.
Currently the update display button isnt working and the image is being displayed on the wrong frame.
